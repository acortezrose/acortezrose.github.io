    <section>
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to ambient music from morning to night. For a few moments, instead of sitting at home under a harsh reading light, infiltrated with the distant clanging of pots and pans, I can be somewhere else entirely—standing in an endless haze of tall grass, listening to a synthesized swell of soft&nbsp;rain.</p>
        <p>I was playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3m7HXeiHpg" target="_blank"><span>Wet Land</span> by Hiroshi Yoshimura</a> as I read assignment descriptions for my master's program privacy class. One titled Privacy Art simply stated, “Produce a piece of privacy-related art and write a reflection on your&nbsp;piece.” </p>
        <p>I thought about the different records I’d been listening to and how they portrayed information through sound. Michael Siegel’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp-n5Ap0d90" target="_blank"><span>The Sounds of the Office</span></a> creates an archive of office sounds in their ordinary environment: coffee breaks, letter opening, typing. While seemingly mundane, this soundscape paints a precise picture of the ecosystem of a single office as it existed in 1964—complete with dictating machines and typewriters.</p>
        <p> NASA’s <span>Symphonies of the Planets</span> drones and swirls on, endlessly re-imagining our solar system’s planets through Voyager data. </p>
        <p>If these ideas could be manifested as music, then privacy should be able to as well, I&nbsp;thought.</p>

        <h2>Privacy policies lack consent</h2>
        <p>The average privacy policy for big-name sites, like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, require up to a 12th-grade reading level. They contain around 4,155 words each and take more than twenty minutes to&nbsp;read.</p>
        <p>
            Twitter lies close to this average level, with a reading level of 13, or college level, a 3764 word count, and a reading time hitting just above 22&nbsp;minutes.</p>
        <p>
            What might this mean for the average internet user? According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 50% of adults in the United States can’t read a book written at an eighth-grade level (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/" target="_blank">Strauss</a>). While it’s unclear what percentage of those adults are navigating the internet, this statistic implies that 50% of US adults cannot read the privacy policy for sites like&nbsp;Twitter.</p>
        <p>
            Twenty minutes may sound relatively short in the context of a 24-hour day. But keep in mind that in addition to time constraints, privacy policies are often packed with dense paragraphs with vague language of little substance to an average user, harkening back to what <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1156972" target="_blank">Fred Cate</a> refers to as “notices that few people read and that few people&nbsp;understand.”</p>
        <p>
            In feminist communities, sexual consent is enthusiastic, freely given, and informed. Since it can never be assumed, you have opportunities to revoke your consent at any time. Since it must be informed, you must have all the facts straight before you can give&nbsp;consent.</p>
        <p>
            Contrastingly, privacy policies often present themselves once during your first experience with a site and maybe again later on in your spam folder. Many people simply want to get to the task at hand, quickly scrolling through to hit the “I agree” checkbox in order to get on with their&nbsp;lives. 
</p>
            <p>
            Taking an impromptu poll, I came to the conclusion that none of my close friends and family had ever read a privacy policy—nor would they care to. As a consequence, they’ve never given informed or enthusiastic consent about the handling of their personal data on the internet, they’ve never even gotten the time to understand it.</p>
        <h2>How I turned Twitter’s privacy policy into&nbsp;music</h2>
        <p>
        With these ideas in mind, I decided to create an ambient track that draws data from Twitter’s privacy policy to represent both its complexity and elusiveness. I took each of the seven sections of the policy and turned them into 8 measures, each informed by data about its density and&nbsp;complexity.</p>
        <p>
        I forked <a href="https://github.com/wbkd/from-data-to-sound" target="_blank">xyflow’s data to sound repo</a>, tweaking it here and there to accept the shape of the data and spit out a MIDI file using Javascript and the Node.js scribbletune module. Each section’s MIDI file contains information about a sequence of notes, their pitches, and their lengths. Notes that are higher and closer together indicate more complicated&nbsp;paragraphs.</p>
        <p>
        I dropped these files into my DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) where I was able to take a lot more creative license, employing sound design to make the MIDI files sound less like a random mess of&nbsp;notes.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>To represent the privacy policy document as a whole, I set the scene with the sound of birds tweeting and a far-off drone. A slow-moving synth creeps in to indicate the scaffolding text of the policy. As Section 1 Information You Share With Us begins, two more sounds move in. The first is a textured pad indicating the duration of this first section. The other sound plays the data generated MIDI notes through a bell-like sample with plenty of distorted&nbsp;echoes.</p>
        <p>I manipulated other effects throughout to represent concepts such as the changing structure of subsections, readability, and reader fatigue. Subsections with formatting like bullet points that stand out receive a jump in modulation, resulting in what sounds like a pitch distortion in the echoes of the&nbsp;bells.</p>
        <p>The policy becomes much more concise and easier to read in Section 5 Children and Our Services, reflected through the reduction in sound coming from the bell synth. But at this point in the policy, the reader is likely growing tired. They have already gone through paragraphs of dense reading. You can hear the slow-moving synth, originally introduced as scaffolding, and the section pads become more and more distorted and randomized until the track fades out and the document&nbsp;ends.</p>
        <p>While Music for Seven Sections alone may still be ineffective at helping users understand the nuances of privacy policies, I think there are interesting and unexplored opportunities to use data sonification as a form of information representation. If nothing else, this project helped me to further appreciate the latent potential of GitHub for art and the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate concepts like a privacy policy and ambient&nbsp;music.</p>
